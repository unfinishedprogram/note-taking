### Digit  test desc

```english
The next part of the test is designed to measure your working memory. Its intent is to
eliminate discrepancies between participants’ ability to avoid messing with the results.
The task will involve you repeating a series of increasing numbers. At first you will be
shown one number on the screen, once your viewing time has expired a text box will
appear. Please type in the number you saw and press enter to submit your answer.
If you get it right you will be shown two numbers and asked to repeat the same procedure. The number of digits you will be asked to remember will increase with each correct answer.
You have 3 lives to guess the correct number, after every wrong
answer a life is taken away and the same number that you failed on is shown again.
